# BitSota

**Decentralized Research Network on Bittensor**

BitSota is a decentralized research network that evolves machine learning algorithms through competitive optimization. We're a problem agnostic platform and enable the optimization of different categories of problems, with a focus on self-improving and self-generating AI.
Currently, Miners develop ML algorithms using genetic programming, while validators evaluate performance and distribute rewards through smart contract voting on the Bittensor network.

## Overview

Bitsota is a platform that allows for decentralized open research problems to continuously evolve machine learning algorithms, state of the art results and self-improving AI. The system supports multiple participation modes to accommodate different hardware capabilities and preferences. BitSota is running without a miner cap and can support a theoretically infinite number of miners.

### Core Components

**Miners:** Evolve ML algorithms using genetic programming and self-improving methods on our fixed CIFAR-10 binary evaluation pipeline, research benchmarks or hidden evaluation criteria. Can operate in direct or pool mining modes.

**Validators:** Evaluate miner submissions independently, verify algorithm performance, and distribute rewards by setting on-chain weights via Yuma consensus.

## Inspiration

BitSota builds on concepts from Google's [AutoML-Zero](https://research.google/blog/automl-zero-evolving-code-that-learns/) research, Schmidhuber's [Goedel Machines] (https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/goedelmachine.html) and Jeff Clune's [AI generating Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10985). We build on this approach by:

- Decentralizing the evolution process across a distributed network of miners
- Using blockchain incentives to drive continuous algorithm improvement
- Implementing competitive markets where miners evolve algorithms in parallel
- Applying cryptoeconomic mechanisms to ensure honest evaluation and quality control

Where AutoML-Zero showed that algorithm evolution is possible in a research setting, Bitsota explores whether market incentives and distributed competition can sustainably produce novel ML algorithms and solve research problems at scale.

## Participation Modes

### Direct Mining

Individual miners evolve algorithms locally and submit breakthroughs to validators. Requires higher compute but offers larger individual rewards.

**Best for:** Experienced miners with dedicated hardware

**[→ Direct Mining Guide](docs/mining.md)**

### Pool Mining

Collaborative mining where participants handle smaller evolution and evaluation tasks. Pool aggregates results and submits to validators on behalf of all participants.

**Best for:** New miners or those with limited compute resources

**[→ Pool Mining Guide](docs/pool-mining.md)**

### Validation

Validators evaluate algorithm submissions, verify performance claims, and vote on rewards through multi-signature smart contracts.

**[→ Validation Guide](docs/validation.md)**

## Architecture

### Direct Mining Flow

```
Miner → Evolve Locally → Beat SOTA → Submit to Relay → Validators Verify → Relay Consensus → Weight Update → Emissions
```

1. Miner runs genetic programming engine for up to 150 generations
2. When algorithm beats State-of-the-Art threshold, submits to relay
3. Validators download submission and independently re-evaluate
4. Validators choose weight setting mode:
   - Relay mode: Vote on relay, wait for consensus, then set weights
   - Local mode: Set weights immediately based on own evaluation
5. Validators set on-chain weights: 90% burn, 10% winner
6. Network emissions flow to winner via Yuma consensus

### Pool Mining Flow

```
Pool → Assigns Tasks → Miners Execute → Pool Consensus → Submit to Validators → Epoch Rewards
```

1. Pool distributes evolution and evaluation tasks to participants
2. Multiple miners evaluate each algorithm (3+ required)
3. Pool computes median consensus with 10% tolerance
4. Rewards distributed based on reputation at epoch boundaries
5. Pool submits best algorithms to validators on behalf of participants
